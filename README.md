The setup is simple, fairly straightforward, except as to to the admin interface, which is somewhat hackish, but effective.

To access the admin interface, add a query string to the url:

index.php?admin

and you will get a password field on the main page. Enter the $adminpass variable, and you'll be logged in. (You'll get banned if you enter it wrong five times).

Once logged in, click on a green quote to switch to edit mode, and save changes (delete button doesn't work yet).
